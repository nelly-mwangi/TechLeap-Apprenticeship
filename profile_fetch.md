# Fetching and Displaying User Data from an API

You are creating a simple profile page that fetches user data from an API:  
 **[https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1)**

---

##  Objective
Fetch and display the **userâ€™s name** and **email** on a webpage.

---

## Approach

To get user data from the API, we use the **`fetch()`** function, which sends a network request and returns a promise.

### Steps:
1. **Use `fetch()`** to call the API.  
2. **Convert** the response to JSON using `.json()`.  
3. **Access** the required data fields (`name` and `email`).  
4. **Display** them dynamically in the webpage.
