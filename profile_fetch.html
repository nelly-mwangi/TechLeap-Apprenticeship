You are creating a simple profile page that fetches user data from an API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1).
 Explain or show code for:
Fetching and displaying the user’s name and email.
To get user data from the API ( https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1), use the fetch() function, which sends a network request and returns a promise.
Use fetch() to call the API.


Convert the response to JSON with .json().

Access the required data fields (name and email).

Display them in the webpage 

Handling the loading and error states.

When fetching data from an API, users should see feedback — either that the data is loading or that an error occurred.
In the loading State before the data arrives, display a message like "Loading user data...". And display this message immediately before the fetch request, and remove it once data arrives.
In the error State If something goes wrong , use .catch() to handle it gracefully and show an error message instead of leaving the user waiting.
