# Git Collaboration

Using Git allows multiple developers to work together efficiently and safely.

### Common Git Command
`git commit -m "message"` â€” records changes to the repository.

### Problem Faced
**Merge conflict:** occurred when two developers edited the same file.  
**Solution:** use branches (`git checkout -b feature-branch`) instead of committing directly to `main`.
